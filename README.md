# contact-book

ðŸ“’ Created a Contact Book Using Python!

Just completed a simple yet practical Contact Book application using Python! This project lets users store, search, update, and delete contact information like names, phone numbers, and emails â€” all from a user-friendly interface.

It was a great hands-on experience for working with:

File handling (saving contacts to a text file or CSV)
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Basic data structures (like lists and dictionaries)

What I loved about this project is how useful it is in real life â€” and how it helped reinforce core programming concepts in a clear, applied way. Iâ€™m planning to expand it with features like contact sorting, search filters, or even database integration.
